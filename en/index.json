By integrating multiscale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced experimental techniques, my group aims to reveal how local structural and chemical disorder governs the macroscopic properties of these complex materials—an area that remains only partially understood. Advancing this fundamental knowledge is both a scientific challenge and a technological imperative, essential for the rational design of next-generation disordered materials with superior performance.\nOver the past decade, I have authored or co-authored over 80 peer-reviewed papers, with more than 6,500 citations and an H-index of 37. As (co-)first or corresponding author, my work has been published in leading journals such as Nature (1), Nature Materials (2), PNAS (7), Nature Communications (6), Nano Letters (2), and Acta Materialia (5), among others.\nResearch Interests: Alloy design of high-entropy alloys and metallic glasses Artificial intelligence for materials discovery and design Additive manufacturing of
